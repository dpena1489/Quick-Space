## Description
Quick space aka QP! An innovative twist on traditional Airbnb stays, with Quick Space you can book a "space" for one hour to a couple of hours. Why do we NEED QP? If someone is coming in from out of town and wants to pregame they can rent a room for a couple of hours, an instructor wants to rent a "space" to teach an hour yoga class, an artist wants to get inspired and rent a space to make music or create art for an hour? well, we have the solution. Sometimes renting a space especially if you only need it for a very short time can be expensive, so book with us to save some money.
